# Smart Translation — Minimal Auth Demo

This workspace includes a minimal FastAPI backend and a React frontend (Vite) demonstrating a production-style login screen (demo only).

Files added:
- `backend/main.py` — FastAPI app exposing `POST /login` with hardcoded credentials for demo (user: `testuser`, pass: `testpass`).
- `backend/requirements.txt` — backend dependencies (fastapi, uvicorn).
- `Frontend/` — Vite React frontend with Login and Dashboard components.

Running backend (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "c:\FI\Smart Translation\ls-smart-translation\backend"
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# start the server on port 8000
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Running frontend (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "c:\FI\Smart Translation\ls-smart-translation\Frontend"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes and TODOs
- This is a demo: passwords are checked against hardcoded values. TODO: add secure password hashing, a user DB, and JWT signing.
- Do not store real tokens in localStorage for production — use secure HttpOnly cookies.
- Enable HTTPS and proper CORS restrictions in production.


## Database Setup

- This project uses PostgreSQL as the backend database.
- Make sure you have PostgreSQL running locally, with the user and database as configured in your environment.

### Example Database URL

```python
# Code Generated by Sidekick is for learning and experimentation purposes only.
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:yourpassword@localhost:5432/postgres"
